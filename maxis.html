        <h2 class="subtitle">overview</h2>
        <p class="content">From October to December 2017, I interned with the UX design team on Project Campfire at EA Maxis, working on the Sims Mobile app - the mobile adaptation from the popular franchise. I worked with designers, product managers, artists, and engineers to create a social networking feature on a game that has accumulated over 2 million downloads worldwide. The game is currently available for free download for Android and iOS devices.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">what I did</h2>
        <p class="content">During my two months at Maxis, I designed the interaction model for a feature known as stickering, or "sticker voting". As part of an initiative to increase player-to-player engagement, stickering was a rewarding way for players to recognize - and be recognized by - other players. Outstanding players were also showcased to a global player base.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">research</h2>
        <p class="content">I worked closely with my mentor, Paul Rybicki, to brainstorm how we would present stickering in the months following the game's soft launch. We wanted stickering to become a regular aspect of the player's routine - a part of their to-do list - without becoming tedious or obligatory. To do so, I researched what kind of message we were trying to communicate with stickering?<br>
        <br> We sketched different ideas for the first time and returning player interactions and whiteboarded the sequence of actions that a player would take for each path of stickering: receiving a sticker, giving a sticker, and the weekly voting contest that would allow players to vote for the most popular Sims to be featured.
        <h2 class="subtitle">questions to consider</h2>
        <p class="content">In creating a social networking feature, i needed to take into account the potential for the platform to be misused as well as the greater implications of 'rating' other players based off appearance; what kind of message were we hoping to send to players by providing them a limited set of stickers to choose from? Would a system of ranking and voting based off popularity - especially in a game in which the primary user base consists of pre-teen girls - contribute to player alienation?
        To better understand how other platforms developed similar systems and interactions, I did a comparative analysis of Facebook, Yelp, and Twitter's user response interactions. ​​​​​​​<br>

        <h2 class="subtitle">creating wires</h2>
        <p class="content">I started by exploring the onboarding process of stickering: when was the first point of contact? How did stickering differ between daily and weekly interactions?  Stickering was designed such that players were encouraged to distribute stickers to other players each day, with the total number of accumulated stickers for each player counting towards a weekly sum. Players with the largest sum of accumulated stickers won the weekly competition and were featured across the global player base. As such, there were multiple different "timelines" of stickering to consider with different actions.
        To better visualize all the possible combinations, I created flows for each of the different timelines for the stickering interaction to understand where there was overlap and potential confusion.

        <h2 class="subtitle">whiteboarding</h2>
        <p class="content">We sketched different ideas for the first time and returning player interactions and whiteboarded the sequence of actions that a player would take for each path of stickering: receiving a sticker, giving a sticker, and the weekly voting contest that would allow players to vote for the most popular Sims to be featured. When we established a flow we felt make sense, we presented our flows to key stakeholders, including project managers and the lead designer.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">daily reminders</h2>
        <p class="content">Stickering happens on two levels: as a daily interaction and a weekly voting contest. Players with the most votes are featured globally to all other players who then vote on their favorite finalist, who is then rewarded with in-game prizes. Players are incentivized to vote for other players in the daily round by receiving a small reward for completing the task as part of their Daily To Do List, which is a pre-existing set of rewarding tasks designed to encourage players to engage in all circles of the Sims world.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">stickering interaction</h2>
        <p class="content">On the receiving end, players whose Sims have been given stickers are notified by whom they were given so as to encourage players to reciprocate the gesture.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">retrospection</h2>
        <p class="content">I left EA in December 2017 after my internship ended. Looking back, I am interested in seeing how the introduction of stickers contributes to the Sims Mobile social network and whether my concerns about player alienation came to be. I'm excited to see what future development on the feature brings to the game.</p>
